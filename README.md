Image Segmentation by Clustering: A Detailed Overview
under guidance of Dr Agughasi Victor Ikechukwu (https://github.com/Victor-Ikechukwu)

1. What is Image Segmentation?
   
Image segmentation divides an image into meaningful segments to make it easier to analyze. These segments represent areas such as objects or boundaries.
Subcategories of Image Segmentation:
Semantic Segmentation: Labels each pixel based on its class (e.g., road, car) but doesn’t differentiate between instances of the same class.
Instance Segmentation: Identifies and segments distinct instances of the same class (e.g., two cars).
Panoptic Segmentation: Combines both semantic and instance segmentation for detailed analysis


2. What is Clustering in Image Segmentation?
Clustering groups similar pixels together based on features like color or intensity. It’s an unsupervised technique used to segment images without labeled data.
Popular Clustering Algorithms:
K-Means Clustering: Groups pixels into k clusters based on color/intensity.
Mean Shift Clustering: Finds modes in feature space for segmentation.
DBSCAN: Groups pixels by density, useful for irregular clusters.



3. Use of Image Segmentation in Image Processing
Image segmentation enhances image analysis by isolating regions of interest, helping with tasks like object detection, feature enhancement, and image compression.

4. Practical Applications of Image Segmentation by Clustering
Medical Imaging: Segment anatomical structures in scans (e.g., MRI, CT).
Satellite Image Analysis: Classify land cover (e.g., water, urban areas).
Object Tracking in Videos: Separate foreground and background in video sequences.
Image Compression: Simplify images by segmenting into regions and reducing data.
